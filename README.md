This code represents a collection of several different games integrated into a menu-driven program. The main menu allows users to select and play different games, including:

    Guess the Number: A game where the player sets a range and guesses whether a randomly generated number is within that range. The player's score is based on their guesses.
    Rock Paper Scissors: A classic game where the player plays against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors. The program keeps track of wins, losses, and total points.
    Tic Tac Toe: A two-player game of tic-tac-toe that uses the console for gameplay.
    Ping Pong: A two-player game of ping pong, implemented in the console.
    Alien Invader: A simple space shooter game where the player controls a character shooting at alien enemies. The player's score is kept track of.
    Scores: Displays a table of scores and statistics for the games played, showing wins, losses, total points, and total games.

The code uses the pygame library for some games and relies on user input to make selections, play games, and navigate the menu. It also includes MySQL database interactions to store and retrieve game scores and statistics for different players. The program is well-structured with modular functions for each game and clear logic for handling gameplay, scoring, and user interactions.
